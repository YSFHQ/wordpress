iFlyChat provides one on one chat and multiple chat rooms for your website.

== Description ==

iFlyChat (also known as DrupalChat) allows visitors of your Wordpress site to chat with each other privately or together in chat rooms. This plugin enables sites to provide online support for their products/services, and thereby increases user engagement. Also, it is useful for social networking sites, forums, blogs, etc. It logs the user conversations so that they can be later viewed in message inbox. You can try it out live [here](https://iflychat.com).

Features

* One on one (private) chat 
* Multiple chat rooms
* Provides a sleek chat bar at bottom right of the browser

* Automatic integration with BuddyPress (shows BuddyPress user avatars and profile links, if present)
* Automatic integration with WP User Avatar
* Automatic integration with Simple Local Avatars
* Chat rooms can be embedded into the page instead of pop-up
